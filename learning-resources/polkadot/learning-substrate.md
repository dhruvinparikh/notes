Guide to learning Substrate.

Here’s one more thing you should add under your belt as a Blockchain Engineer, building decentralized applications using substrate.

What is Substrate?

It is a completely open-source project built using Rust and some other programming language.

Think of it as being like Express or another web application framework that allows you to build decentralized systems by implementing a very small number of hooks in your code.
It provides you with all the core components needed to build a distributed network such as database, networking, consensus, and transaction queue.
