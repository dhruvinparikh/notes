            * Currently,
              * Building $DINERO
              * Blockchain Instructor at York University
            * Previously,  
              * CTO and lead Blockchain Developer at opty.fi
              * Adjunct Professor at George Brown College 
            ---
            ## Topics
            * Decentralized Finance
            * Order book based exchange
            * Decentralized Exchange
            * Constant Product AMM
            ---
            ## Decentralized Finance
            * **DeFi**: Financial systems built with smart contracts as the platform for enforcing rules, instead of legal system
            * The intersection of economics and blockchain technology
            * Benefits are: transparent and permissionless
            ---
            ## Trading Order book (OB)

            ---
            ## OB fundamentals
            * Buyers/Sellers express their intent to trade by submitting bids/asks
            * These are Limit Orders (LO) with a price P and size N
            * Buy LO (P, N) states willingness to buy N shares at a price ≤ P
            * Sell LO (P, N) states willingness to sell N shares at a price ≥ P
            * OB aggregates order sizes for each unique price
            * A Market Order (MO) states intent to buy/sell N shares at the best
            possible price(s) available on the OB at the time of MO submission
            ---
            ## OB limitations
            * Higher transaction fees and slower transaction speeds.
            * Each trade requiring on-chain validation, the underlying network’s throughput can become a bottleneck, thus affecting the overall efficiency of the exchange.
            * off-chain OB DEX have centralization risk
            ---
            ## Decentralized Exchange
            * Platforms that facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading without relying on intermediaries or centralized authorities.
            * Operate on blockchains, allowing users to trade directly with one another while retaining control over their private keys and funds.
            ---
            ## Constant Product AMM
            * An AMM is a special contract that buys and sells an asset according to specific rules
            * Uniswap is most famous example on Ethereum
            ---
            ## Constant Product Rule

            * Uniswap has a simple rule: The product of the amounts of the assets is a constant
                  <br/>x * y = k
            * You can swap an amount of token for another amount, but you need to keep the product the same
            ---
            ## Constant Product Rule, 2

            * Suppose there are 10 of token A and 4 of token B
                 <br/> k = 10 * 4 = 40
            * The price of A in units of B is
                 <br/>4 / 10 = 0.4
            * The price of B in units of A is
                 <br/>10 / 4 = 2.5
            ---
            ## Constant Product Rule, 3

            * I want to buy exactly 2 units of A so I withdraw 2 A tokens from reserves, leaving 8 A tokens
            * How many Bs must there now be?
                  <br/>8 * B = 40
                  <br/>B = 40 / 8
                  <br/>B = 5
            * Since B started at 4 tokens I need to deposit 1 unit of B to bring it up to 5
            ---
            ## Constant Product Rule, 4

            * Now there are 8 of token A and 5 of token B
            * `k` remains 40 <span style="margin-left: 20px; color: green; font-size: 120%">&check;</span>:
            <br/>k = 8 * 5 = 40
            * The price of A in units of B goes up:
            <br/>5 / 8 = 0.625
            * The price of B in units of A goes down:
            <br/>8 / 5 = 1.6

                // e.g. buy only _amountTokenA of TokenA for any price of TokenB
                function swapTokenBForExactTokenA(uint256 _amountTokenA) external {
                    uint256 _tokenBRequired = ((tokenAReserves * tokenBReserves) /
                        (tokenAReserves - _amountTokenA)) - tokenBReserves;
                    tokenAReserves -= _amountTokenA;
                    tokenBReserves += _tokenBRequired;
                    emit AmountTokenBRequired(_tokenBRequired);
                }
            }
            ```
