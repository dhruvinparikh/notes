## Zoom etiquetes

* Do not record the Zoom meeting.
* Please keep your mic muted unless you are speaking, to minimize background noise
* Please keep your video on. We would like to make our online class experience as close to a regular in-person class. You would not want to be invisible to the instructor and your classmates if you were attending a regular in-person class.
* Feel free to use the Zoom chat. The staff and/or other students can answer questions during the lecture. The instructor may not be able to monitor the chat in real time.
* Raise your hand (physically) to signal that you have a question. Should the instructor overlook your raised hand, unmute your mic, then say “question”.

## What a distributed system should do?
* Ability for the user across the world to interact with each other
* Agree on common truth without trusting a single machine or authority
* Consensus?  

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## trust without trust
* Trust general protocol and math behind it
* No need to trust
 * Execution of individual processes
 * Reliability of any individuals
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Majority opinion; general agreement
* Trivial when there is only one actor

## Time, Clocks and Ordering of Events in distributed systems 
<img src="time-clocl-ordering.webp" width="500">
Note:
Early literature had focused on enabling coordination of processes
where these processes could be processes on a CPU or computers in a network,
separated spatially. 
Time, Clocks and Ordering of Events in distributed systems is written by leslie lamport
in late 70s

It shows that two events occurring at separate physical time can be concurrent so long as they don't
affect one another. Ordering the occurrence of events is important such as measurement of a sensor or
detection of error and subsequent error correction as well as determining which event actually took place
is crucial to correct functioning of a distributed system
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Agreement to system state
* Data loss and corruption prevention
 * Getting processes on same page on who can write what data at what time
* In blockchain, full nodes agree on some state of system depending on implementation
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Why study consensus?
* **Bitcoin** : agree on who owns the bitcoin?
* **Ethereum** : users agree on correct execution of the transactions and general state of the network
* Consensus attempts to creates reliable system from potentially unreliable parts :
 * Computers in aircraft / data centers
 * Malicious actors in public blockchain
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Distributed Systems
* Definition
 * A set of independent **nodes** each representing a **process** 
 * **Message channels** for information between nodes, establishing a network
* Purpose :
 * Accomplish a common goal
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Properties of distributing systems
* Concurrency : information in the system is processed concurrently
* No global clock : Each node is responsible for maintaining its own time
* There is a potential for failure of any individual component, whether this be a dropped message or a failed processor
</script></section>

## Node
</p>

<div class="left"><p data-markdown>
* Any device connected to the distributed network
  * servers
  * computers 
  * laptops
  * online or desktop wallets
  * mobile phones

</section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Responsibility of a node
* Validate a new block
* Store and save the transaction history of a block
* Update other nodes in the blockchain to ensure all nodes on th blockchain have the latest information
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Types of Node
* Generally categorized based on sync modes
  * Full node
  * Light node
  * Mining node
  * Archive node
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Full node
* Validates all transactions and blocks. 
* All full nodes support the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, 
validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
* A full node validates transactions and blocks and accepts transactions and blocks from other full nodes to support the Bitcoin network. 
* Store recent few blocks plus checkpoints at few block interval till genesis 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Light node
* Depend on full nodes for functioning. 
* Only download blockheaders from the Bitcoin blockchain. 
* Verify transactions in the blockchain using simplified payment verification (SPV)
* Require less download and storage capacities than full nodes. 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Mining node (Miners)
* solve complex cryptographic puzzles in a process referred to as “mining”
* Each miner aims to be the first node to create a new block in the blockchain and to prove that it is the one that has performed the required work (hence Proof of Work). 
* Once the entire network verifies a transaction, a new block is added to the existing blockchain and the miner receives a reward
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Archive node
* Host the entire blockchain 
* Take up more hard-drive space than the pruned full node. 
* Archive of historical states by downloading not only block header but also block metadata
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## So..
* What is the key difference between full node and mining node?
* What is the key difference between full node and archive node?

## Trilemma of distributed system
</p>

<div class="left"><p data-markdown>
* Fundamental theorem of any distributed system pertaining to achievable properties   
</p></div>

<div class="right" >
  <img src="cap-theorem-diagram.webp" style="border: none;" />
</div>

</section>

<section data-markdown style="font-size: xx-large;"><script type="text/template">

## CAP theorem introduction
* Consistency 
  * every node provide most recent state of the system
  * no two nodes will return different states
  * no node will return outdated state
* Availability
 * system allows to make updates and retrieval to state w/o delay
* Partition tolerance
 * partition is inability of two or nodes to communicate with each other
 * partition means messages will not get to their recipient
 * "partition tolerance" is an ability to function inspite of partition in the network
<br/>*IRL, a system can only have two of three of these properties at any given time*
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## CAP Example (PA)

* A database stores my favourite color
* After I graduate from this bootcamp, the color will be say change from blue to red
* I sent the update to system and it went to Node 1
* Node 1 relays updated state message to others
* Node 2 and 4 somehow can't receive update so are not aware of the change in state
* if I query Node 2, it will avail me the color but not the red.Consistent.

## Byzantine fault tolerance

* Possibilities were distributed systems can fail

<div class="right">
  <img src="The-Traitorous-General.png" style="border: none;" />
</div>

</section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Practical Byzantine fault tolerance
* No solution for 1/3 traitors
* Solution to all remaining cases : PBFT
 * PBFT gives an algorithm to allow nodes to come to consensus with no more than 1/3 byzantine 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Practical Byzantine fault tolerance
* Works in a small group of ~50 close nodes
* Communication is trivial
* Consensus is achieved via voting
 * Employs voting via "leader" nodes in round robin format on rotational basis.
 * If the leader acting maliciously, they can be removed by a majority votes from nodes
 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Faults in distributed systems

* fail-stop 
  * Node crashes and hence cannot return values
* Byzantine fault 
  * Arbitrary deviance from the protocol : means not only the nodes might stop replying or receiving information
    but also send corrupt and false information

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Does this relate to blockchain fundamentals?

* A blockchain is simply a data structure governed by a distributed system with an unbounded and unknown number of
  byzantine fault possible
* Inspite of adversial environment, blockchain makes it possible for everyone to come to a consensus 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Challanges in distributed system
* Following are of paramount importance for distributed system 
  * Verifying authenticity
  * Process of building agreement among a network of mutually distrusting participants.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Issues of pBFT with bitcoin
* pBFT can't scale for Bitcoin because :
 * Consensus in bitcoin depends on entire state og blockchain
 * Validity of all of its transactions is distributed to thousands of nodes which continually connect and disconnect 
* There is a need for inherent cost to participating in bitcoin like system of consensus to discourage participants from acting maliciously 
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solving Bitcoin consensus problem
* Bitcoin can operate as a BFT, open and P2P distributed network via
 * PoW mining consensus algorithm
 * Specific set of rules that govern mechanism in order to achieve trustless consensus across the network.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Nakamoto Consensus
* Set of rules in conjunction with Proof-Of-Work consensus model in the network that govern the consensus mechanism and ensure its trustless nature
* Bitcoin became first BFT, open and distributed P2P network that utilizes a distributed network of anonymous nodes that are free to join and leave the network at will 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Nakamoto Consensus
* Miners solve partial preimage hash puzzle
* Prevent Sybil attacks
<br/><br/>
Resource(s) consumed = Computational power
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Nakamoto Consensus
 
* Proof Of Work
* Block Selection
 * Lottery process for miners
* Scarcity
 * Block reward halved every 210,000 blocks (~ 4 years)
 * Deflationary - mined to 21 million 
* Incentive structure
 * Miners are incentivized to validate and secure the network honestly,
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof Of Work
* Evidence
* Spent resources
* Need to solve a problem via brute forcing
 * Like brute forcing a password -- trial and error
* Demo simple PoW in blockchain
</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cons of PoW
* PoW is highly computationally expensive, hence terrible for the environment
* Another pitfall is that it can be quite insecure; with small networks it can (and has been multiple times) be exploited via a 51% attack
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Overview of Proof of Stake
* Validators instead of "miners"
* Locking up "stake"
<br/><br/>
* Resources consumed 
 * Native currency

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof of Stake
* Proof of Stake serves as a simple modification over PoW that solves these problems
* PoS allows for miners to get a block reward proportional to the amount of currency that they already own

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof of Stake
* This way, instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS miner is limited to mining a percentage of transactions that is reflective of his or her ownership stake. For instance, a miner who owns 3% of the Bitcoin available can theoretically mine only 3% of the blocks.

<br/><br/>
More hashing power != more mining rewards

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Nothing at Stake Problem
* However, validators do not have anything at stake when the network forks; they can simply bet on all the forked chains since they have no incentive mechanism to choose
* Some versions of Gasper(used in Ethereum) punish users who engage in such behavior as it can lead to lack of protection against double spend

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Validator Shuffling
* Validators can be malicious; the Beacon Chain protects against this by assigning validators to commitees
* Committees make decisions on blocks and Gasper ensures that all validators are randomly distributed in such a way that "committees are more or less an accurate statistical representation of the overall validator set"

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof Of Spacetime

* "The idea of proof-of-capacity is to require network participants to demonstrate a financial interest in the success of the network by allocating some form of memory or disk space towards it"
* Miners have to "seal" data that enters the network and periodically have to "prove" they have the data

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What does Bitcoin provide?
* Account and Identity management
 * address for every user associated with amount of currency
* Services
 * Transactions between users done by other users
* Record Management
 * Redundant information stored between thousands of users via blockchain
* Trust 
 * Personal incentive aligning with community goals

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What is the role of identity in context of currencies?
* Receiving money
* Claiming/Spending money
* Blame
* Identity in daily life :
 * Houses have addresses and mailbox keys
 * Emails have aliases and passwords
 * Bitcoin has public keys and private keys
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Public and private keys
* Each entity is represented with a unique public key
 * A corresponding private key acts as a key to “unlock” the public key, the proverbial chest containing your money
* Private key chosen at random, public key generated from private key
 * Public key for receiving, private key for redeeming
</script></section>

## What if somebody guesses my private key?
* Bitcoin is hidden in the large amount of public keys

## Block Header: Hash
* Unique fingerprint of this block
* Combines various other parts of the block to ensure uniqueness
* Each block stores the previous block's hash, and uses it to compute its own hash
* Transactions can be hashed sequentially but there's a better way 
 * Merkle Trees

## Block Header: Proof-of-Work
* A quick primer on SHA and hashing: 
* Serves as a fingerprint
 * Pseudorandom bit generator
 * 2^128≈3.6×10^13 years. In comparison, our universe is only about 13.7×10^9 years old

## Block Contents: UTXO

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Block Contents: UTXO

* A transaction Output consists of a cryptographic lock and a value. For now, you can imagine that the outputs are somehow locked and the input provides a key to unlock them. The value is simply the amount in satoshis (1 sat = 10^-8 BTC) that is locked inside the output.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Block Contents: UTXO

* Every Transaction input consists of a pointer and an unlocking key. The pointer points back to a previous transaction output. And the key is used to unlock the previous output it points to. Every time an output is successfully unlocked by an input, it is marked inside the blockchain database as “spent”.

<section data-markdown style="font-size: xx-large;"><script type="text/template">

## Addresses and Keys

* If you own some Bitcoin, you will possess the following:
 * A public key: Used to verify your transactions on the blockchain; used to generate the bitcoin address
 * A private key: Required for you to execute transfer of funds from your account
 * A bitcoin address: Represents your Bitcoins; others can send/receive funds via your address
* A Bitcoin wallet generally is just a manager for your keys - this is why you need to control your keys!!

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Conflicts

* What if there are multiple miners that solve a PoW problem simultaneously?
 * Unlikely but not impossible
 * This leads to a fork. Multiple blocks could be added to all the subchains in the fork
 * We need a mechanism to decide between forks

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The longest Chain Rule

* The chain with "the most work" is always favored by the network
* That is to say, if there are multiple chains in a fork, the one with the most subsequent work will win

## The longest Chain Rule

![](longest-chain.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Hard Fork

* Miners can disagree about consensus/scalability/etc.
* If the sentiment is strong enough, groups of them work together to create a new fork that is a hard fork
* These cannot be reconciled with the new blocks on the "main chain"
* Biggest example: BTC and Bitcoin Cash 
* Others: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic
